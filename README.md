## Acknowledgments
The structure of this repo is largely based on [semantic_uncertainty](https://github.com/jlko/semantic_uncertainty). The black-box methods' implementation is taken from [UQ-NLG](https://github.com/zlin7/UQ-NLG) while the summarization part is taken from [lm-polygraph](https://github.com/IINemo/lm-polygraph). We are very grateful for their open sources.
