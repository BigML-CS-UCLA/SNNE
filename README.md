## Install Requirements
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate snne
pip install flash-attn==2.6.1 --no-build-isolation
pip install -e .
```

## Data Preparation
For almost all tasks, the dataset is downloaded automatically from the Hugging Face Datasets library upon first execution.
The only exception is BioASQ (task b, BioASQ11, 2023), for which the data needs to be [downloaded](http://participants-area.bioasq.org/datasets) manually and stored at `./data/bioasq/training11b.json`.

## Demo
### Generate answers + Compute SE, NE, DSE, and pTrue
- QA
```bash
./scripts/generate/generate_qa.sh
```

- Summarization
```bash
./scripts/generate/generate_summarization.sh
```

- Translation
```bash
./scripts/generate/generate_translation.sh
```

### Compute other UQ methods
- SNNE and WSNNE
```bash
./scripts/compute/compute_snne.sh
```

- Graph baselines (SumEigv, Deg, Eccen) + NumSet + LexSim
```bash
./scripts/compute/compute_graph_baselines.sh
```

- KLE
```bash
./scripts/compute/compute_kle.sh
```

- LUQ
```bash
./scripts/compute/compute_luq.sh
```

- SAR
```bash
./scripts/compute/compute_sar.sh
```

- Eigenscore
```bash
./scripts/compute/compute_eigenscore.sh
```

The structure of this repo is largely based on [semantic_uncertainty](https://github.com/jlko/semantic_uncertainty). The graph baselines are adapted from [UQ-NLG](https://github.com/zlin7/UQ-NLG) while summarization and translation parts are adapted from [lm-polygraph](https://github.com/IINemo/lm-polygraph). We are very grateful for their open sources.
